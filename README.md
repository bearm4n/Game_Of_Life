# Game_Of_Life
The Game of Life is set in an infinite two-dimensional grid inhabited by “cells”. Every cell interacts with up to eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. From an initial seed grid the game "evolves" one iteration at a time.


For this task I will be using the programming language Java.

I assumed that the user can input the size of the game they want to play using sliders.

I also assumed that there should be 200 iterations of the game as this gives the game enough time to show the user all the variuos scenarios that the game can play.

I have used ' # ' symbols to show the living cells, the dead cells are represented by using '   ' blank spaces.
