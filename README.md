# Game_Of_Life
The Game of Life is set in an infinite two-dimensional grid inhabited by “cells”. Every cell interacts with up to eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. From an initial seed grid the game "evolves" one iteration at a time.


For this task I will be using the programming language Java.
